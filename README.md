# BetterLegacyLights
A Beat Saber mod that brings back the original function of BetterStaticLights.   
This mod ONLY WORKS on V1/V2 environments, or those that existed prior to OST V's "Interscope" environment.

## Dependencies
- BSIPA v4.3.5+
- SiraUtil v3.1.14+
- BeatSaberMarkupLanguage v1.12.4+

## Features
- Total control of which sets of lights are active in classic environments.
- A switch to use the Left Saber color instead of the Right Saber color for a light set.
- Very lightweight and performance-minimal.
